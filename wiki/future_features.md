# Features backlog

- [ ] Update so in debug mode the workflow is updated as the events occur, rather than writing all at the end.
- [ ] More graceful handling of timeout.
- [ ] Budget overshoots?  Only checks budget at state transition?  (Maybe no way around this)
- [ ] Configuration file per project to define defaults
- [ ] Default --dangerously-skip-permissions to true
- [x] Default to --debug mode with option to disable
- [x] Default budget of $10
