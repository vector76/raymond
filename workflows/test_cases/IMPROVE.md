Read workflows/test_cases/test_files/improve-output.txt (create it if it doesn't exist with "Draft 1").

"Improve" the content by incrementing the draft number and adding one word.
Write the result back to workflows/test_cases/test_files/improve-output.txt.

Example: "Draft 1" becomes "Draft 2 banana"

Then request another iteration:
<goto>IMPROVE.md</goto>
