You are in phase 1. Generate a random 4-digit number and remember it.

Write "Phase 1 generated: [your number]" to workflows/test_cases/test_files/reset-output.txt.

Also write something that ONLY exists in your context (do not write it to any
file): "The secret word is: elephant"

When done, signal a reset to phase 2:
<reset>PHASE2.md</reset>
