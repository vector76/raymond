You are in phase 2, starting with fresh context.

First, read workflows/test_cases/test_files/reset-output.txt to see what phase 1 generated.

Now answer these questions by appending to workflows/test_cases/test_files/reset-output.txt:
1. What number did phase 1 generate? (read from file)
2. What was the secret word from phase 1? (you should NOT know this)

Be honest - if you don't know the secret word, say "I don't know".

Then respond with:
<result>Reset test complete</result>
