The polling script (POLL_EXAMPLE.sh) has detected work to be done.

In a real workflow, this state would contain instructions for the LLM
to analyze or process the discovered work item. For this test case,
simply acknowledge that polling succeeded and work was found.

Respond with:
<result>Polling workflow succeeded - work was found and processed</result>
